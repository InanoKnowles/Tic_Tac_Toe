# Tic_Tac_Toe
My first project with General Assembly is to create a game called Tic Tac Toe.

## About

- How to use my awesome project:
```
1. Click on the link above,
2. Better on a smaller screen,
3. X always goes first - One player is 'X' and the other is 'O'
4. First to 3 in a row wins
5. Draw = BOTH players lose
6. Have fun!
```

- Add in app screenshots.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving

- Thought about what we would need as we approached itBroke down the steps into manageable chunks
- Broke down the steps into manageable chunks and found anything else that was a bit toooo chunky and broke those steps down some more
- Wireframed what I would like the game to look like

## :rocket: Cool tech

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- DOM MANIPULATION WITHIN JAVASCRIPT

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:

- Draw Condition - Background color only shows up in certain cases, text still apears to say the round was a win
- At one point no matter who clicked on the square be it 'X' or 'O' it kept changing between the two
- Buttons to not click too many times (cause its broken :unamused:)Yeah.....don't open the browser wide LOL

## :sob: Lessons learnt

What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...I would...
- start at the second I was given the task instead of a whole day and half later
- planned everything FIRST and not during the coding part
- asked for help sooner rather than later for specific things
- I would make it look SO GOOD
- make it work first and then make it pretty 

## :white_check_mark: Future Features

cool things I would add if I can keep working on this...would to really show off my interests as a gamer. I would make it Stardew Valley themed and made the grid play area a garden plot with the vegetables('X') vs plants('O') theme. They get planted in sprout form and the winner's plants springs out into its fully grown form and if theres a draw both players sprouts go into their withered form. I would add every combination for winning, losing and draws and its a must have to jam along with the stardew valley theme music whilst playing the game.
